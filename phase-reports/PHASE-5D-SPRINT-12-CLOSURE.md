# Phase 5 Closure Report

**Phase:** 5 — Mission Control Center ("See Everything, Including What's Missing")
**Sprints:** 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
**Date:** 2026-03-26
**Status:** closure_status=closed (operator sign-off: 2026-03-26)

## Phase Goal

Build a Mission Control Center that provides full visibility into the governed multi-agent system, including real-time updates and operator intervention capabilities.

## Sprint Deliveries

| Sprint | Phase | Scope | Key Outputs |
|--------|-------|-------|-------------|
| 8 | 5A-1 | Backend Read Model | FastAPI on :8003, normalizer, cache, circuit breaker, 7 read endpoints |
| 9 | 5A-2 | React Read-Only UI | 6 pages, error boundaries, data quality badges, freshness indicators |
| 10 | 5B | SSE Live Updates | File watcher, SSE manager, heartbeat, reconnect with backoff |
| 11 | 5C | Intervention / Mutation | Approve/reject/cancel/retry, CSRF, mutation lifecycle, audit |
| 12 | 5D | Polish + Closure | E2E tests, OpenAPI, operator guide, accessibility, benchmark |

## Architecture

```
Mission Controller → File System → File Watcher → SSE Manager → React UI
                                                                    ↓
                                         Mutation Button → Signal Artifact → Controller
```

Key principle: **API never directly calls services** (D-001). It only writes atomic signal artifacts that the runtime/controller consumes.

## Decisions (Phase 5)

| Range | Count | Scope |
|-------|-------|-------|
| D-059→D-070 | 12 | Sprint 8 — API design, security, schemas |
| D-081→D-084 | 4 | Sprint 9 — UI architecture |
| D-085→D-088 | 4 | Sprint 10 — SSE transport |
| D-089→D-092, D-096 | 5 | Sprint 11 — Mutation lifecycle |
| D-097→D-101 | 5 | Sprint 12 — Polish decisions |
| **Total** | **30** | Phase 5 decisions |

## Scoreboard: 15/15 PASS

| # | Criterion | Result |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | 9 governed roles | PASS |
| 2 | Role health monitoring | PASS |
| 3 | SSE real-time transport | PASS |
| 4 | Signal → Approval → Execution E2E | PASS |
| 5 | Atomic signal artifact bridge | PASS |
| 6 | Contract-first tests | PASS |
| 7 | Operator drill 5/5 | PASS |
| 8 | E2E tests 12+ scenarios | PASS (16 scenarios) |
| 9 | Accessibility > 90 | PASS (Lighthouse headless: 95) |
| 10 | Performance benchmark | PASS (<50ms) |
| 11 | API documentation | PASS (14 endpoints) |
| 12 | Operator guide | PASS (11 sections) |
| 13 | Legacy dashboard resolved | PASS (D-097) |
| 14 | Decision debt zero | PASS (D-001→D-101 frozen) |
| 15 | All tests passing | PASS (302 total, 0 fail) |

## Test Coverage

| Suite | Count | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Backend (pytest) | 234 | All pass |
| Frontend (vitest) | 29 | All pass |
| E2E (httpx+pytest) | 39 | All pass |
| TypeScript | 0 errors | Clean |
| ESLint | 0 warnings | Clean |
| **Total** | **302** | **0 failures** |

## What Phase 5 Achieved

1. **Full visibility** — Every mission state, stage, gate result, and policy deny visible in the UI
2. **Real-time updates** — SSE transport with exponential backoff and polling fallback
3. **Operator control** — Approve/reject approvals, cancel/retry missions from the dashboard
4. **Data quality transparency** — 6-state quality indicators show exactly what data is available
5. **API-first** — 14 documented endpoints with frozen schemas, OpenAPI spec auto-generated
6. **Security** — Localhost-only, Host validation, CORS, CSRF protection, SSE abuse prevention

## What's Next (Phase 6)

Per `docs/ai/NEXT.md`:
- Browser-level E2E tests (deferred from Sprint 12)
- Approval model changes (D-099)
- Legacy dashboard code removal (Sprint 13)
- Phase 2 security hardening (if needed)
