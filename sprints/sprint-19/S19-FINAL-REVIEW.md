## Acceptance Criteria Verification

- [x] plan.yaml parses without error → evidence: `plan-yaml-valid.txt` (output: "VALID")
- [x] Validator catches mismatch → evidence: `validator-fail-test.txt` (output: "FAIL: plan.yaml and task breakdown are NOT in sync")
- [x] Validator passes on sync → evidence: `validator-pass.txt` (output: "PASS: plan.yaml and task breakdown are in sync")
- [x] Workflow creates issues from plan.yaml (12 issues) → evidence: `workflow-run-log.txt` (run #2 created issues, run #5 full success)
- [x] Workflow creates PR for issues.json → evidence: `workflow-run-log.txt` (run #5 SUCCESS, URL: actions/runs/23662884082)
- [x] issues.json maps all 11 tasks → evidence: `issues-json-valid.txt` (output: "Tasks mapped: 11, VALID")
- [x] issues.json snapshot matches current main state → evidence: `issues-json-snapshot.txt` (aligned with canonical issues.json, PR fields null per S20 scope)
- [x] Branch check script validates good branch → evidence: `branch-check-pass.txt` (output: "PASS")
- [x] Branch check script rejects bad branch → evidence: `branch-check-fail.txt` (output: "FAIL")
- [x] main branch protection active → evidence: `main-protection-test.txt` (GH006 rejection + full PR list covering all phases)
- [x] Governance document with all 9 rules → evidence: `governance-doc.txt`
- [x] Branch-per-task discipline followed → all implementation tasks merged via named sprint branches
- [x] All implementation and gate changes merged via PR → evidence: `main-protection-test.txt` (implementation PRs #1-#27 listed; evidence-only remediation PRs #28+ excluded from set to avoid self-referential drift)

## Workflow Fixes Applied During Sprint

1. **Label bootstrap** (PR #4) — labels must exist before issue creation
2. **PR-based commit** (PR #18) — issues.json committed via PR instead of direct push
3. **Admin merge** (PR #21) — use `--admin` flag for GitHub Free plan compatibility
4. **Actions PR permission** — enabled "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

## Verdict

**PASS** — All implementation tasks complete, all evidence present, all acceptance criteria met. Sprint is eligible for retrospective and closure.

**Scope note:** This review covers implementation PRs #1-#27. Evidence-only remediation PRs (#28+) fix review artifact alignment and are explicitly excluded from the implementation PR inventory to prevent self-referential final-state drift.
