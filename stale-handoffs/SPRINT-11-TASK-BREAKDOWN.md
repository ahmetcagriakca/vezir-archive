# Sprint 11 — Phase 5C: Intervention — Task Breakdown

**Date:** 2026-03-26
**implementation_status:** done
**closure_status:** closed
**Author:** Operator (AKCA) + Claude Opus 4.6
**Prerequisite:** Sprint 10 closure_status=closed
**Risk Level:** HIGH — read-only → read-write transition, mutation safety critical
**Estimated Duration:** 5-7 days

---

## Section 1: Sprint Goal

Deliver operator intervention from the dashboard: approve, reject, retry, cancel. Transition from read-only sprints (8-9-10) to mutation sprint. Every mutation writes an atomic request artifact; runtime/controller remains the sole executor. Every mutation is auditable, server-confirmed, and SSE-correlated.

**Definition of Done (all must be true):**
- 4 mutation endpoints working (approve, reject, cancel, retry)
- CSRF protection on all mutation endpoints (D-089)
- Atomic request artifact bridge — no direct controller/service method calls (D-001, D-062, D-063)
- D-096 lifecycle enforced: requested → accepted → applied | rejected | timed_out
- Every mutation audited (requestId, tabId, sessionId, operation, targetId, outcome)
- SSE mutation events: mutation_requested, mutation_accepted, mutation_applied, mutation_rejected, mutation_timed_out
- Destructive actions (cancel, reject) require confirmation dialog (D-090)
- Server-confirmed UI refresh, no optimistic UI (D-091)
- Approval sunset Phase 1: dashboard approve \<id\>, Telegram yes/no deprecated warning (D-092)
- Contract-first tests all PASS (11 tests)
- Operator drill 5/5 PASS
- GPT mid-review PASS, GPT final review PASS
- Retrospective produced
- 0 TypeScript errors, 0 lint errors, production build success

---

## Section 2: Frozen Decisions

### D-089: CSRF — SameSite=Strict + Origin Header Check

**Phase:** 5C | **Status:** Frozen

Localhost + single-operator + modern browser → SameSite=Strict cookie + Origin header validation. Double-submit cookie unnecessary complexity for this environment. Mutation endpoints reject requests without valid Origin header (→ 403).

**Trade-off:** Less protection than double-submit cookie on older browsers. Acceptable: system is localhost-only (D-070).

### D-090: Mutation Confirmation — Confirm Dialog for Destructive Actions

**Phase:** 5C | **Status:** Frozen

Destructive actions (cancel, reject) → confirmation dialog before request. Non-destructive actions (approve, retry) → single click. No undo mechanism — mutations are irreversible.

### D-091: Mutation UI — Server-Confirmed (No Optimistic UI)

**Phase:** 5C | **Status:** Frozen

Mutation request → wait for server response → SSE event confirms state change → UI refreshes. No optimistic state updates. 100-500ms delay acceptable — operator dashboard, not real-time trading.

**Trade-off:** Slower UX but zero chance of showing incorrect state.

### D-092: Approval Sunset Phase 1

**Phase:** 5C | **Status:** Frozen

Dashboard approve \<approvalId\> / reject \<approvalId\>. Telegram yes/no still works but shows deprecated warning. Full removal in Sprint 12 (D-095).

### D-096: Mutation Response Contract — Full Lifecycle

**Phase:** 5C | **Status:** Frozen

Every mutation endpoint returns:
```json
{
  "requestId": "req-uuid",
  "lifecycleState": "requested",
  "targetId": "approval-id or mission-id",
  "requestedAt": "ISO-8601",
  "acceptedAt": null,
  "appliedAt": null,
  "rejectedReason": null,
  "timeoutAt": null
}
```

Lifecycle: `requested → accepted → applied | rejected | timed_out`
- `requested` = API persisted signal artifact. Response returns immediately.
- `accepted` = controller consumed signal, validation passed (SSE: mutation_accepted)
- `applied` = state transition completed (SSE: mutation_applied)
- `rejected` = validation failed (SSE: mutation_rejected)
- `timed_out` = controller did not process within 10s (SSE: mutation_timed_out)

API response always returns `lifecycleState=requested`. Subsequent states via SSE only. Client stores requestId, correlates via SSE. Fire-and-forget forbidden.

### OD-10 Resolution: Retry Semantics

**Status:** Frozen

Retry = existing controller `retry_mission()` triggered via atomic signal artifact → creates new mission with link to failed original. Same semantics as runtime retry (D-008 chain depth limit applies).

### OD-13 Resolution: Mutation Rate Limit

**Status:** Waived

Localhost single-operator system. D-070 provides sufficient access control. No additional rate limiting for Sprint 11. If multi-user access is added in the future, rate limiting becomes mandatory.

---

## Section 3: Mutation Bridge Architecture

**Single Rule (D-001, D-062, D-063):**
API mutation endpoint only writes atomic request artifact; runtime/controller remains sole executor.

### Signal Flow

```
Dashboard UI
  → POST /api/v1/approvals/{id}/approve
    → API validates request (CSRF, FSM state, target exists)
    → API writes atomic signal artifact:
        logs/missions/{missionId}/approve-request-{uuid}.json
    → SSE: mutation_requested (best-effort emit, may be missed)
    → API returns { lifecycleState: "requested", requestId: uuid }

Note: ordering is artifact persisted → SSE best-effort → HTTP response.
Response is source of truth. If SSE mutation_requested is missed,
client still has lifecycleState=requested from the response.

Controller (next poll cycle, ~1s):
  → Reads signal artifact
  → Validates (FSM state check, idempotency)
  → If valid:
      → approval_service.approve(id)
      → FSM state transition
      → Removes signal artifact
      → SSE: mutation_accepted → mutation_applied
  → If invalid:
      → SSE: mutation_rejected (reason)
  → If timeout (10s):
      → SSE: mutation_timed_out
```

### Signal Artifact Format

```json
{
  "requestId": "req-uuid",
  "type": "approve",
  "targetId": "approval-id",
  "missionId": "mission-id",
  "requestedAt": "ISO-8601",
  "source": "dashboard",
  "operatorInfo": {
    "tabId": "tab-uuid",
    "sessionId": "session-id"
  }
}
```

### Mutation Endpoints

| Method | Path | Action | Signal Artifact |
|--------|------|--------|----------------|
| POST | `/api/v1/approvals/{id}/approve` | Approve pending approval | `approve-request-{uuid}.json` |
| POST | `/api/v1/approvals/{id}/reject` | Reject pending approval | `reject-request-{uuid}.json` |
| POST | `/api/v1/missions/{id}/cancel` | Cancel running mission | `cancel-request-{uuid}.json` |
| POST | `/api/v1/missions/{id}/retry` | Retry failed mission | `retry-request-{uuid}.json` |

### Audit Log Fields

Every mutation logs to `logs/mission-control-api.log`:
- `timestamp`, `source: "dashboard"`, `operation`, `targetId`, `outcome`, `requestId`, `tabId`, `sessionId`

---

## Section 4: SSE Mutation Events (D-086 Extension)

Added to Sprint 10 event registry:

| Event Type | Trigger | Data |
|-----------|---------|------|
| `mutation_requested` | API persisted signal artifact | `{ requestId, targetId, type }` |
| `mutation_accepted` | Controller consumed signal, validation passed | `{ requestId, targetId, type }` |
| `mutation_applied` | Controller completed state transition | `{ requestId, targetId, type, newState }` |
| `mutation_rejected` | Controller validation failed | `{ requestId, targetId, reason }` |
| `mutation_timed_out` | Controller did not process within 10s | `{ requestId, targetId }` |

Frontend correlates via `requestId`: mutation button → store requestId → listen SSE → match → update UI.

**Event ordering rule:** Signal artifact atomically persisted → SSE `mutation_requested` best-effort emit → HTTP response returns `lifecycleState=requested`. Response is the source of truth. If SSE `mutation_requested` is lost (disconnect, race), client proceeds on HTTP response alone. SSE events for subsequent states (`accepted`, `applied`, `rejected`, `timed_out`) remain the only channel.

## Section 9: Implementation Notes

| Planned | Actual | Reason |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 11.2 + 11.3 separate commits | Combined into one commit (`6013eb2`) | Both small, no dependency conflict, parallel tasks |
| 11.5 + 11.6 separate commits | Combined into one commit (`e25053e`) | Same pattern, shared MutationResponse schema |
| 11.7-11.10 separate commits | Combined into one commit (`7054938`) | ConfirmDialog, useMutation, buttons, feedback are tightly coupled |
| Test 2: SSE accepted/applied | Changed to mutation_requested mock | accepted/applied are controller-side, not API-side |
| Test 7: file-based audit check | Changed to logging capture | Audit uses Python logging, not direct file write |

## Section 11: Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Mutation bypasses runtime (D-001 violation) | CRITICAL | 11.4: atomic signal artifact only. Script checks no direct method call in API layer |
| CSRF token bypass | HIGH | D-089: SameSite + Origin. Localhost-only (D-070) |
| Race condition: 2 tabs same approval | MEDIUM | Server-side idempotency: already approved → 409 |
| Approval state transition invalid | MEDIUM | FSM validation: only approval_wait → approve/reject |
| Cancel during active LLM call | MEDIUM | Graceful cancellation signal, timeout |
| Signal artifact left unprocessed | LOW | Controller polls every 1s. 10s timeout → mutation_timed_out SSE |

**Risk mitigation rule:** API mutation endpoint only writes atomic request artifact; runtime/controller remains sole executor (D-001, D-062, D-063).

## Section 13: Closure Deliverables

When implementation_status=done:

1. `bash tools/sprint-closure-check.sh 11` → evidence/sprint-11/closure-check-output.txt
2. Contract grep → evidence/sprint-11/contract-evidence.txt
3. Operator drill → evidence/sprint-11/mutation-drill.txt
4. This document: Results section + exit criteria updated
5. STATE.md updated (1 line)
6. NEXT.md updated

No separate phase report. This document's Results section is sufficient.

## Section 14: Retrospective

### Net Judgment

Sprint 11 went well. Read-only → mutation transition was solidly built with contract-first approach. 11 tests written first (all FAIL), endpoints implemented after, 11/11 PASS. v3 process rules (two-axis status, evidence-based closure, review gate) fully applied for the first time.

### What Went Well

- **Contract-first testing:** Writing 11 tests first, proving they all FAIL, then implementing endpoints to reach PASS created a reliable development cycle.
- **Atomic signal artifact pattern:** Zero D-001 violations — API never calls controller/service directly. Grep evidence proves this.
- **Mid-review gate:** Requiring GPT review before moving from backend to frontend reduced rework risk on frontend tasks.
- **Evidence-first closure:** Every claim backed by raw grep/test output. "Code inspection" language eliminated via mid-review patch.

### What Broke

- **Commit granularity:** Tasks 11.7+11.8+11.9+11.10 squeezed into single commit (4 tasks, 1 commit). Rule says "1 task = minimum 1 commit" but tightly coupled frontend tasks made separation impractical.
- **Test count arithmetic:** Wrote "195 + 29 + 11 = 224" but 11 contract tests are already included in 195. GPT caught this. Inconsistent numbers in evidence create noise.
- **D-089 language mismatch:** Decision says "SameSite=Strict + Origin" but implementation has no SameSite cookie config — only Origin middleware exists. Gap between decision text and implementation language remained. GPT caught this too.
- **Turkish content in documents:** Retrospective and some report sections were written in Turkish. All repository documents (task breakdowns, reports, evidence, decisions) must be in English. Turkish is chat-only language.
- **GPT review report not proactively prepared:** Review report was only created when explicitly requested by operator. Report preparation should be automatic before every GPT review gate.

### Root Cause

- Commit granularity: Frontend component interdependency (ConfirmDialog → useMutation → buttons) makes atomic commits difficult. Planning phase should separate "shared component" tasks from "page integration" tasks.
- Test count: Manual arithmetic used instead of `pytest --co -q | tail -1` raw output (v3 rule 21 already mandates this — was not followed).
- D-089: "SameSite=Strict" was a browser behavior assumption mixed with the enforced "Origin check" in middleware. Gap between decision and implementation should have been caught during freeze.
- Turkish content: No explicit rule existed separating chat language (Turkish) from document language (English). Rule now added to copilot-instructions (Section 1).
- Report preparation: No explicit rule required proactive report generation before review gates. Architect waited for operator request instead of treating report preparation as a gate prerequisite.

### Actions

| # | Action | Owner | Deadline | Output |
|---|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| A-01 | In Sprint 12, separate frontend tasks into "shared component" and "page integration" with distinct commits | Copilot | Sprint 12 kickoff | Commit plan in task doc |
| A-02 | Test counts in reports must always come from `pytest --co -q \| tail -1` and `vitest list \| wc -l` raw output, never manual arithmetic | Copilot | Sprint 12 | Process rule |
| A-03 | Fix D-089 decision text: "Origin header check enforced; SameSite depends on browser cookie context" | Claude | Sprint 12 Task 0 | DECISIONS.md patch |
| A-04 | Add to Sprint 12 kickoff gate: "Evidence counts must come from raw command output, not manual totals" | Claude | Sprint 12 kickoff | PROCESS-GATES.md patch |
| A-05 | All repository documents must be in English. Turkish is chat-only. Rule added to copilot-instructions Section 1. | Claude | Immediate | copilot-instructions.md patch |
| A-06 | GPT review report must be proactively prepared before every review gate — not waiting for operator request. Rule added to copilot-instructions Section 12. | Claude | Immediate | copilot-instructions.md patch |

### Carried to Next Sprint

- A-01 → Sprint 12 task doc commit plan
- A-03 → Sprint 12 Task 0 DECISIONS.md update
- A-04 → Sprint 12 kickoff gate addition

### Stop Rules

None. No recurring error across 3 consecutive sprints (stop rule threshold not triggered).

## Section 15: Results

### Status

- **implementation_status:** done
- **closure_status:** closed

### Summary

Sprint 11 delivered the full mutation layer: 4 endpoints (approve, reject, cancel, retry), CSRF middleware, atomic signal artifact bridge, mutation audit logger, D-096 lifecycle response, and frontend mutation UI (ConfirmDialog, useMutation hook, approve/reject/cancel/retry buttons with feedback). Approval sunset warning (D-092) added to Telegram path.

### Test Counts

| Suite | Count | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Backend (all, includes contract tests) | 195 | ✅ ALL PASS |
| └ of which: contract tests (Sprint 11) | 11 | ✅ ALL PASS |
| Frontend (all) | 29 | ✅ ALL PASS |
| **Total** | **224** (195 backend + 29 frontend) | **0 failures** |

### Build Artifacts

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| TypeScript (tsc --noEmit) | 0 errors |
| ESLint | 0 errors |
| Vite build | 206KB JS, success |
| Backend pytest | 195 passed, 0 failed |
| Frontend vitest | 29 passed, 0 failed |

| 5 | ~~closure-check.sh~~ | ~~Operator~~ | ✅ Done — ELIGIBLE FOR CLOSURE REVIEW |

### Architecture Compliance

| Rule | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| D-001: API writes signal artifact only | ✅ | ownership-grep.txt — NO MATCHES |
| D-089: CSRF Origin check enforced | ✅ | Test 9 PASS (403 without Origin). SameSite=Strict depends on browser cookie context — no explicit cookie config in API; Origin validation is the enforced layer. |
| D-090: Destructive confirm dialog | ✅ | ConfirmDialog.tsx + reject/cancel use it |
| D-091: Server-confirmed, no optimistic | ✅ | useMutation waits for SSE, no local state |
| D-092: Telegram sunset warning | ✅ | approval_service.py APPROVAL_SUNSET log |
| D-096: Full lifecycle response | ✅ | MutationResponse schema + 11/11 tests |
